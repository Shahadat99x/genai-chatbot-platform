# Headache Overview

Headaches are a very common condition that causes pain and discomfort in the head, scalp, or neck.

## Common Types

- **Tension headaches**: Mild to moderate pain, described as feeling like a tight band around the head.
- **Migraines**: Severe, throbbing pain, often on one side of the head, accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light/sound.
- **Cluster headaches**: Intense, piercing pain behind one eye.

## Self-Care

- Rest in a quiet, dark room.
- Hot or cold compresses to your head or neck.
- Massage and small amounts of caffeine.
- Over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen.

## Red Flags (Emergency)

Seek immediate care if:

- You have the "worst headache of your life".
- Headache starts after a head injury.
- Headache is accompanied by fever, stiff neck, confusion, seizure, double vision, or weakness.
- Headache gets worse despite rest and pain medication.
