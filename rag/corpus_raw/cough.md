# Cough Overview

A cough is your body's way of responding when something irritates your throat or airways. An irritant stimulates nerves that send a message to your brain. The brain then tells muscles in your chest and abdomen to push air out of your lungs to force out the irritant.

## Home Management

- Drink fluids to thin the mucus in your throat. Warm liquids, such as broth, tea, or lemon juice, can soothe your throat.
- Suck on cough drops or hard candy. (Avoid giving these to children under age 3).
- Use a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer to add moisture to the air.
- Avoid tobacco smoke.

## When to See a Doctor

Seek medical attention if:

- Your cough lasts longer than a few weeks.
- You are coughing up thick, greenish-yellow phlegm.
- You are wheezing.
- You have a fever.
- You experience shortness of breath.
- You cough up blood (Emergency).
