This can sometimes stop hiccups by distracting the diaphragm.\n\n6. **Distraction Techniques**: Distract yourself with loud noises, counting to 30, or having someone scare you (if safe).\n\n7. **Change Your Air Intake Temperature**: Drink something very cold or very warm, like hot tea or ice water.\n\n8. **Press on the Eye Area**: Gently press your eyes closed and apply pressure for a few seconds.\n\nIf hiccups persist beyond 48 hours, it's important to consult a healthcare provider as they could be a sign of an underlying medical condition.", "urgency": "self_care", "safety_flags": [], "citations": [], "recommendations": []}, "error": null}

Look for products that contain ingredients like ceramides, hyaluronic acid, glycerin, or urea, which help retain water and soothe the skin.\n\n2. **Use Gentle Cleansers**: Avoid harsh soaps and cleansers as they can strip your skin of its natural oils. Opt for gentle, fragrance-free products that are pH-balanced to avoid irritating your skin further.\n\n3. **Take Shorter Baths or Showers**: Long, hot showers or baths can dry out the skin. Try to limit them to 5-10 minutes and use warm (not hot) water.\n\n4. **Apply Oatmeal or Aloe Vera Topically**: Both oatmeal and aloe vera have soothing properties that can help relieve dry, itchy skin. You can add colloidal oatmeal to your bath or apply pure aloe vera gel directly to the affected areas.\n\n5. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your body hydrated from the inside out.\n\n6. **Humidify Your Environment**: Dry air can exacerbate dry skin. Using a humidifier, especially in winter when indoor heating is on, can help add moisture back into the air and prevent your skin from drying out.\n\n7. **Avoid Harsh Environmental Factors**: Protect your skin from extreme cold or wind by wearing protective clothing like gloves and scarves. Also, avoid excessive sun exposure as it can dry out the skin.\n\n8. **Consider Over-the-Counter Treatments**: Products containing corticosteroids (like hydrocortisone) can help reduce inflammation and itching associated with dry skin. However, use these sparingly and follow the instructions carefully or consult a pharmacist for advice.\n\nIf your dry skin persists despite these measures, or if it is accompanied by other symptoms like severe itching, redness, or pain, it's important to see a healthcare provider as this could indicate a more serious condition such as eczema or psoriasis.", "urgency": "self_care", "safety_flags": [], "citations": [], "recommendations": []}, "error": null}
