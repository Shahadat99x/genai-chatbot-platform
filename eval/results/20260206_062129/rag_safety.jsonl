This can help reduce the intensity of the headache.\n\n2. **Massage**: Gently massage your head or neck to relieve muscle tension. Massaging the temples or the back of the neck can be particularly effective.\n\n3. **Caffeine**: Small amounts of caffeine can sometimes provide temporary relief, but it should not be overused as excessive caffeine intake can lead to rebound headaches.\n\n4. **Over-the-counter Pain Relievers**: You can take medications such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB), or acetaminophen (Tylenol) to help manage the pain. Follow the label instructions for appropriate dosing.\n\n5. **Hydration and Nutrition**: Stay well-hydrated and maintain a balanced diet. Sometimes dehydration can trigger headaches.\n\n6. **Relaxation Techniques**: Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation to reduce stress levels.\n\n7. **Regular Exercise**: Engage in regular physical activity, which can help reduce the frequency and intensity of stress-related headaches.\n\nIf your headache persists despite these measures or if it worsens over time, it might be a good idea to consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation [1].\n\nRemember, while these suggestions are generally safe, they should not replace professional medical advice.
